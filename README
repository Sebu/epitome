steeps
1. find all matches
2. minimize epitome chart
3. create epitome atlas

TODO:
- more and exclude debug vis. (interface)
- move calc. to thread
- asserts/exceptions
- commandline/lib 
- serialize/save matches
- speedup steep one (some opencv profiling needed)
- start steep two
- steep three

DONE:
- use opencv2 c++ binding instead of c binding
- vis. all matches
